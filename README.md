# Problem Statement:
Youth nowadays handle cash without any knowledge of how to deal with it, and
when it comes to spending their own cash, it becomes difficult to meet their
financial obligations.
So, it is fundamental for them to follow their costs for better administration of
their cash and to expand their savings. With the assistance of this application,
users can work out their complete expenses each day and these outcomes will be
given to the user. As the traditional methods of budgeting, we need to maintain
the notes, and files for the user daily and monthly expenses. Keeping a log in diary
is a very monotonous process and also may sometimes lead into problems due to
the manual calculations. Looking on every one of the above given conditions, we
are attempting to fulfil the users necessities by building a web application which
will help them decrease their burdens.
"Expense Tracker Application" is an application that allows the user to enter their
daily expenses at the end of the day to see their expenses in charts. Based on the
analysis of their daily expenses, the application gives suggestions on how to
increase their passive income.
